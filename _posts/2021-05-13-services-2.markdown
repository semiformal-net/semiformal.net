  I left my job as Director or Data Science and Model Innovation at Scotiabank. I have begun a new job at a FinTech startup called [Finaptic](https://finaptic.com/). We are building a white-label banking-as-a-service platform to help businesses access financial products in a modern way. I lead their analytics team where I am in in charge of all types of consumer decision modeling like risk, fraud, and cross-sell.
