I have been giving some talks lately on machine learning in credit risk. Most recently at NVIDIA GTC 2021 (watch at [nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s31327/) or [youtube](https://youtu.be/y8cq8tEadZc)) and at World Alliance of Financial Center's *Global Webinar Series on AI in Finance: Focus on North America.* The events were both held virtually so I will post recordings when available.
