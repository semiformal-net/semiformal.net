  We have submitted a [MITACS](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate) research proposal in collaboration with the University of Manitoba to study LLMs in credit risk.

  Demonstration code for boosted scorecards that we wrote with NVIDIA is available [here](https://github.com/rapidsai-community/showcase/tree/main/event_notebooks/GTC_2021/credit_scorecard) - [email me](mailto:paul.edwards@semiformal.net) if you need help using it.

  I've paused work on my python credit risk data science book for now. If you'd like to get updates click [here](https://semiformal.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3cb64c2d50083841e15e976a9&id=d2349c4597).
